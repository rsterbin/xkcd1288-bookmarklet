xkcd1288-bookmarklet
====================

Bookmarklet to make the substitutions in [xkcd #1288](http://xkcd.com/1288/ "xkcd #1288")

Using
=====

The current version of this bookmarklet can be found [here](http://grey17.paranoiacs.org/~rsterbin/xkcd1288.html).  Bookmark the link at the bottom of that page to install.

Making Changes
==============

If you want to test the changes you make to bookmarklet.js, you can use `build_markup.sh > test.html` to create a file with the bookmarklet you can open in your browser.

You'll need to adjust `build_markup.sh` for your own environment, as the paths are just hardcoded to where I put the YUI compressor and bash.

**Now includes [xkcd #1418](http://xkcd.com/1418/ "xkcd #1418")**
